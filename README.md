==================

All vendors provide their own OpenCL implementations and samples to showcase the
 features of their implementations. Here we target to teach, learn, explore,
 benchmark and enjoy OpenCL as it is there in KHRONOS standard. The initial idea
 to create program under following header: Tutorials, Domain-Specific OpenCL
 applications, OpenCL Spec Correctness tests, Performance benchmarks for memory
 and compute, and OCL Compiler tests. 

The second focus here is to use C++ standard code, which should probably compile
 in both windows and linux environments without issue. Also it will be helpful
 to create utility classes to reduce coding efforts and express the key features
 in a better way.
